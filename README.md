# praatscripts
Scripts for analyzing sounds using [Praat](http://www.fon.hum.uva.nl/praat/), created in whole or in part by Hiram Ring.

This repository contains several Praat scripts that automate various analyses for users. Descriptions of the scripts are contained within the scripts themselves, or in additional README files in folders where the scripts reside. Contributions/fixes/features are welcomed and encouraged.
